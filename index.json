[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"I am currently a research fellow at Singapore University of Technology and Design working with Georgios Piliouras and Antonios Varvitsiotis. My main research interests lie at the interface between reinforcement learning, online learning in games and stochastic optimization.\nMy research develops theory and algorithms for multi-agent learning in sequential decision problems where multiple agents interact strategically. I study how autonomous agents learn to make decisions sequentially under uncertainty in settings where structured and non-stationary objectives shape long-term behavior. My work synthesizes tools from reinforcement learning, game theory, online learning, stochastic optimization, and dynamical systems to build principled and robust multi-agent learning systems.\nSee below for a more detailed overview of my research.\nPreviously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at ETH Zurich working with Niao He in the department of computer science. I obtained my PhD in applied mathematics and computer science from Institut Polytechnique de Paris at Télécom Paris under the supervision of Pascal Bianchi and Walid Hachem. I received my engineering Master's degree in applied mathematics and computer science from Télécom Paris and a Master's degree in data science from Université Paris Saclay.
