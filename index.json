[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"I obtained my PhD in December 2021 from Institut Polytechnique de Paris at Télécom Paris in the S2A (Signal, Statistics and Learning) team where I was co-advised by Prof. Pascal Bianchi and Prof. Walid Hachem.\nMy research interests generally lie in reinforcement learning theory and optimization for machine learning. Most of my thesis was devoted to the analysis of \u0026lsquo;adaptive\u0026rsquo; gradient methods (such as ADAM, RMSProp, AdaGrad, \u0026hellip;) and momentum methods for non-convex stochastic optimization using stochastic approximation tools. More recently, I investigated the use of target networks in actor-critic algorithms.\nI obtained my engineering Master\u0026rsquo;s degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science from Télécom Paris in 2018. I also received a Master\u0026rsquo;s degree in Data Science from Université Paris Saclay in 2018. You can find more information about me on my CV.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://anasbarakat.github.io/author/anas-barakat/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/anas-barakat/","section":"authors","summary":"I obtained my PhD in December 2021 from Institut Polytechnique de Paris at Télécom Paris in the S2A (Signal, Statistics and Learning) team where I was co-advised by Prof. Pascal Bianchi and Prof.","tags":null,"title":"Anas Barakat","type":"authors"},{"authors":["Anas Barakat","Pascal Bianchi","Julien Lehmann"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1625875200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625875200,"objectID":"7acc6392080430129f11abcf0a4ee520","permalink":"https://anasbarakat.github.io/publication/actor-critic/","publishdate":"2021-07-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/actor-critic/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Analysis of a Target-Based Actor-Critic Algorithm with Linear Function Approximation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anas Barakat","Pascal Bianchi","Walid Hachem","Sholom Schechtman"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1625875200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625875200,"objectID":"8888b7a832cbe9a558d89e811b542999","permalink":"https://anasbarakat.github.io/publication/adamplus20/","publishdate":"2021-07-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/adamplus20/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Stochastic optimization with momentum:  convergence, fluctuations, and traps avoidance","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1602752400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602752400,"objectID":"0cb587626765c471e5086b69c907cf6d","permalink":"https://anasbarakat.github.io/talk/sem_bordeaux20/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/sem_bordeaux20/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Invited talk -
